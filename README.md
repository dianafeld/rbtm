# ROBO-TOM
Web service-oriented application for carrying out computed tomography experiments with data processing (numpy, scipy) and visualization. Currently used in the laboratory in Institute of Crystallograhy. The system enables multiple users to take CT scans, store (mongoDB, HDF5) and browse collected imagery via a web-based UI (Django, Flask) operating on top of a TANGO-based network interface to CT hardware.
